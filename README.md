# R-Homework_5

## Project Description

This project uses Java and the implementations of Factory and Strategy design
patterns in order to build the automation of a Pizza Store. This program also 
involves the use of Enum classes with methods and assigned values. The main purpose 
of this program is to manage pizza orders, which includes methods for updating
toppings, pizza price, and cooking strategies.

## Dependencies

No external libraries or dependencies are necessary for this project.

## Instructions

To run this program, clone this repository to your local workspace. 
Make any changes to the Main file as desired. Then, compile and run the 
Main file. 

## Contributions

Individual contributions to this project were evenly split across the four group
members. Joe (@hargu) implemented the AbstractPizza class, each pizza type subclass, 
the PizzaCookingFactory class, and two Enum classes. Jessica (@jxie26) implemented 
the methods in the AbstractPizza file, added the default values in the constructor
for each pizza type subclass, and wrote the README file. Rianna (@riannaellis) 
implemented the ICookingStrategy interface, each cooking strategy subclass, two methods, 
and the Main class. Finally, Neela (@neelaanjali) implemented the PizzaOrder class and
and 7 methods.
